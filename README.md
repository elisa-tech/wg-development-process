# wg-development-process
The Kernel Development Process WG will be working on a predefined list of tasks agreed by the group.  
The task list will be updated from time to time, as tsaks are completed or rejected, when relevant.
The initial task list agreed by the WG is outlined below.
For each task there is a dedicated owner.  Owner responsibilities include:
   - Initial scoping 
   - Track status and provide leadership
   - Handover / park the task if they can no longer spare the time to own

For each task we define:
  - Goals and scope of the topic
  - "Definition of Done" for that task - e.g., create a skeleton of the document for review with one section fully populated.
  - Milestones
